        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Connecticut, focusing on AI alignment and technical governance. My research has been recognized with awards from workshops at NeurIPS and ICLP, and I have published AAAI on quantifying misalignment.</p>
        
        <p>I am advised by Prof. Shiri Dori-Hacohen in the <a href="https://infothreats.cse.uconn.edu/">Reducing Information Ecosystem Threats (RIET) Lab</a>. I founded <a href="https://www.beacon-ai.club/">Beneficial and Ethical AI at UConn (BEACON)</a>, which has grown to serve over 30 students across six concurrent fellowship cohorts.</p>
        
        <p>My work spans technical AI safety research, policy development, and risk assessment. I contribute to frontier AI safety through the OpenAI Red Teaming Network, where I have identified vulnerabilities in early-stage computer-using agent systems. I also serve on the Leadership Council of the Collegiate Coalition for AI Policy, coordinating AI safety advocacy across university student groups nationwide.</p>
