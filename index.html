        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Connecticut, focusing on AI alignment and technical governance. My work spans AI safety research, policy coordination, and technical red teaming. I am advised by Prof. Shiri Dori-Hacohen in the <a href="https://infothreats.cse.uconn.edu/">Reducing Information Ecosystem Threats (RIET) Lab</a>, and I am the founder and president of <a href="https://www.beacon-ai.club/">Beneficial and Ethical AI at UConn (BEACON)</a>.</p>
        
        <p>I currently serve as a founding member of the Leadership Council for the National Policy Advocacy Network, coordinating AI safety communication and advocacy across U.S. university student groups. I also contribute to AI safety through technical work as part of the OpenAI Red Teaming Network and as a member of the Future of Life Institute's AI Safety Community Researchers.</p>
